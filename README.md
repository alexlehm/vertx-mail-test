# Vert.x unit example test

Example unit test using the vertx unit test poc by Julien.

This test is basically the same as the test class MailDummyTest from the vertx-mail package converted to async unit test.

To run this you have to install [vertx-unit](https://github.com/vietj/vertx-unit) first with mvn install, since the package is not yet available as snapshot on sonatype.
